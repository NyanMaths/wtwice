I only use Arch btw. I guess it works the same on other distros, these packages are commonly used,
just do not forget that python2 still exist on some.

Required packages : gcc python opencv vdk python-pillow python-numpy python-pathlib


waifu2x_ncnn_vulkan is available on Arch repositories, but more tricky to install otherwise
This one is not necessary at all.
